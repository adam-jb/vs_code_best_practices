To run python in VS code

Cmd + shift + p -> Python: Start REPL


To put REPL on RHS:
On top right click ‘split editor right’ icon, which looks like a picture of an open book
On bottom right there is a list of window: drag the one called ‘REPL’ into the empty space the step above created


To set highlighted code to run on cmd + enter
Go to Code -> preferences -> keyboard shortcuts. Then click ‘Open keyboard shortcuts (JSON’) at top right. Then paste the below and save it:
[
    {
        "key": “cmd+enter,
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText"
    }
]
