## On testing
Unit = piece of code to be tested, eg: a function or class

unit tests often follow this format:
assert(function_name(param_tested), 'expected_result')  

Developers typically run unit tests even before committing code to a repository

Python tests are Python classes that reside in separate files from the code being tested

In same folder as script with funcs to test, make script with object and test methods. Give is a name starting with 'test'

Click on glass beaker icon on LHS to see tests. Configure, setting to use 'unittest' and search for '*test' extentions

Can then run all tests or one test at a time by clicking on play button on a test's line of code in the test script
